How the App Works:
When users open Weather App, they're greeted with a Welcome Screen showing the app name, developer info, and a logo, along with a button to move to the Main Screen. There, the app displays daily high temperatures using two arrays and a loop, while also calculating and showing the weekly average. A Back button lets users return to the first screen.
